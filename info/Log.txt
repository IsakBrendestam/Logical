** To Do **
[X] Change all MouseState (ms) to static class (MS)
[X] Implement buttons for all current gates
[X] Implement or gate
[ ] Saving System
[ ] Implement xor gate
[ ] Implement Clock
[ ] Implement Constants
[ ] Implement removal of connection
[ ] Seperate Buttons from Toggles
[ ] Custom Gates
[ ] Add textures


** ISSUES **
[X] Can connect to pin on same gate
[X] Can connect input to input and output to output
[X] Can create connection when moving gate
[X] Problem when removing gate with 2 connections to 1 output
[X] Can push ui button when moving gate
[X] Crashes when all gates has been removed
[ ] Problem with update order (see Bug4.png)


** Optimization **
[ ] Optimize deletion of connection when gate is deleted
